                    An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky.[1] Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.

                    The benefits of adventure travel allow you to improve your physical and mental health. Engaging in challenging activities forces you to focus your energy on what you are doing at that moment. Ultimately, this helps relieve your overall stress levels.

                    Participating in adventure travel may seem intimidating to some, but that should not stop you. Try something new and do a mini adventure before planning your big trip. This way you can start small with low risk involved.

                    When researching your trip, decide what you want to do and where you want to go. There are various levels of difficulty you can choose from when deciding on a location and adventure. You can either take it easy or test your physical abilities.

                    To be fit and healthy you need to be physically active. Regular physical activity can help protect you from serious diseases such as obesity, heart disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and arthritis. Riding your bicycle regularly is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of health problems associated with a sedentary lifestyle.

                    Cycling is a healthy, low-impact exercise that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, from young children to older adults. It is also fun, cheap and good for the environment.

                    Riding to work or the shops is one of the most time-efficient ways to combine regular exercise with your everyday routine. An estimated one billion people ride bicycles every day – for transport, recreation and sport.

                    <h2>Para Gliding</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="para">
                    Paragliding is a great sport for both young and old. However, it is not the cup of tea for everyone, since there are people who find the sport to be intimidating. Others don’t give it a shot at all, because they fear the heights involved. That said, the crux of the matter is, that paragliding can help this group of people to overcome their fears. Once a person experiences how easy, relaxing, and exciting the sport is, their concerns will automatically go away. Getting that initial confidence boost will play a key role in helping a person take their skills to the next level.

                     To minimise the chances of mishaps or injuries, relying on trusted instructors is critical. You will also need to be in the right attire, with the correct accessories for maximum fun. For instance, don’t go into the sport with slippers. You just don’t want to lose your footwear while in the air. If possible, wear sports shoes to make your paragliding experience better.
